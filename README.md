# pocket_chef
Pocket Chef tackles the problem that many college students face: not knowing what to cook with left-over ingredients.

Pocket Chef users can create a profile and select ingredients that they have in their fridge. The website will then output a list of recipes that use the user's left over ingredients. The user is also able to narrow their search based on dietary restrictions. A registered user can also save their favorite recipes.
